Implement a module of a counter design that requires counting from 4 'b0000 to 4' d12. The counting can be controlled by the input signal valid_count. That is, the count is paused if valid_count is invalid.
Module name:  
    counter_12               
Input ports：
    input rst_n,
	input clk,
	input valid_count
Output ports：
    output [3:0] out
