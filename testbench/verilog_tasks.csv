You are a professional hard RTL code engineer. Please complete the writing of verilog as required.,"Create a set of counters suitable for use as a 12-hour clock (with am/pm indicator). Your counters are clocked by a fast-running clk, with a pulse on ena whenever your clock should increment (i.e., once per second).

reset resets the clock to 12:00 AM. pm is 0 for AM and 1 for PM. hh, mm, and ss are two BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) digits each for hours (01-12), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59). Reset has higher priority than enable, and can occur even when not enabled.

You are a professional hard RTL code engineer. Please complete the writing of verilog as required.,"Build a 64-bit arithmetic shift register, with synchronous load. The shifter can shift both left and right, and by 1 or 8 bit positions, selected by amount.

An arithmetic right shift shifts in the sign bit of the number in the shift register (q[63] in this case) instead of zero as done by a logical right shift. Another way of thinking about an arithmetic right shift is that it assumes the number being shifted is signed and preserves the sign, so that arithmetic right shift divides a signed number by a power of two.

There is no difference between logical and arithmetic left shifts.

You are a professional hard RTL code engineer. Please complete the writing of verilog as required.,"A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR is one particular arrangement where bit positions with a ""tap"" are XORed with the output bit to produce its next value, while bit positions without a tap shift. If the taps positions are carefully chosen, the LFSR can be made to be ""maximum-length"". A maximum-length LFSR of n bits cycles through 2n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is never reached).

The following diagram shows a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. (Tap positions are usually numbered starting from 1). Note that I drew the XOR gate at position 5 for consistency, but one of the XOR gate inputs is 0.

You are a professional hard RTL code engineer. Please complete the writing of verilog as required.,"Conway's Game of Life is a two-dimensional cellular automaton.

The ""game"" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:

0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.
2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.
3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.
4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.
The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc. (This tool accepts SystemVerilog, so you may use 2D vectors if you wish.)

You are a professional hard RTL code engineer. Please complete the writing of verilog as required.,"In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored.

(In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)

We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with bit[3]=1.

You are a professional hard RTL code engineer. Please complete the writing of verilog as required.,"We want to add parity checking to the serial receiver. Parity checking adds one extra bit after each data byte. We will use odd parity, where the number of 1s in the 9 bits received must be odd. For example, 101001011 satisfies odd parity (there are 5 1s), but 001001011 does not.

Change your FSM and datapath to perform odd parity checking. Assert the done signal only if a byte is correctly received and its parity check passes. Like the serial receiver FSM, this FSM needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 9 (data and parity) bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

You are provided with the following module that can be used to calculate the parity of the input stream (It's a TFF with reset). The intended use is that it should be given the input bit stream, and reset at appropriate times so it counts the number of 1 bits in each byte.

You are a professional hard RTL code engineer. Please complete the writing of verilog as required.,"Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a ""flag"" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing ""flags"", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s.

Create a finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:

0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

You are a professional hard RTL code engineer. Please complete the writing of verilog as required.,"Consider the FSM described by the state diagram shown below:

This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal r[i] = 1, where r[i] is either r[1], r[2], or r[3]. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state A as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device’s g[i] signal to 1. Each g[i] is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state A. Once a device, i, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, r[i] = 1.

The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input called resetn.

The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset).

is started when a particular pattern (1101) is detected,
shifts in 4 more bits to determine the duration to delay,
waits for the counters to finish counting, and
notifies the user and waits for the user to acknowledge the timer.
In this problem, implement just the finite-state machine that controls the timer. The data path (counters and some comparators) are not included here.

The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the state machine must then assert output shift_ena for exactly 4 clock cycles.

After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is waiting for the counters, and waits until input done_counting is high.

At that point, the state machine must assert done to notify the user the timer has timed out, and waits until input ack is 1 before being reset to look for the next occurrence of the start sequence (1101).

The state machine should reset into a state where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.

Here is an example of the expected inputs and outputs. The 'x' states may be slightly confusing to read. They indicate that the FSM should not care about that particular input signal in that cycle.

The serial data is available on the data input pin. When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay. I'll refer to this as the delay[3:0].

After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles. Also output the current remaining time. This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).
