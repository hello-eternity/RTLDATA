OpenLane Architecture#
OpenLane Design Stages#
OpenLane flow consists of several stages. By default all flow steps are run in sequence. Each stage may consist of multiple sub-stages. OpenLane can also be run interactively as shown here.
Synthesis
yosys/abc - Perform RTL synthesis and technology mapping.
OpenSTA - Performs static timing analysis on the resulting netlist to generate timing reports
Floorplaning
init_fp - Defines the core area for the macro as well as the rows (used for placement) and the tracks (used for routing)
ioplacer - Places the macro input and output ports
pdngen - Generates the power distribution network
tapcell - Inserts welltap and decap cells in the floorplan
Placement
RePLace - Performs global placement
Resizer - Performs optional optimizations on the design
OpenDP - Performs detailed placement to legalize the globally placed components
CTS
TritonCTS - Synthesizes the clock distribution network (the clock tree)
Routing
FastRoute - Performs global routing to generate a guide file for the detailed router
TritonRoute - Performs detailed routing
OpenRCX - Performs SPEF extraction
Tapeout
Magic - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the routed def
KLayout - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the routed def as a back-up
Signoff
Magic - Performs DRC Checks & Antenna Checks
KLayout - Performs DRC Checks
Netgen - Performs LVS Checks
CVC - Performs Circuit Validity Checks
OpenLane integrated several key open source tools over the execution stages:
RTL Synthesis, Technology Mapping, and Formal Verification : yosys + abc
Static Timing Analysis: OpenSTA
Floor Planning: init_fp, ioPlacer, pdn and tapcell
Placement: RePLace (Global), Resizer and OpenPhySyn (formerly), and OpenDP (Detailed)
Clock Tree Synthesis: TritonCTS
Fill Insertion: OpenDP/filler_placement
Routing: FastRoute or CU-GR (formerly) and TritonRoute (Detailed) or DR-CU
SPEF Extraction: OpenRCX or SPEF-Extractor (formerly)
GDSII Streaming out: Magic and KLayout
DRC Checks: Magic and KLayout
LVS check: Netgen
Antenna Checks: Magic
Circuit Validity Checker: CVC
Everything in Floorplanning through Routing is done using OpenROAD and its various sub-utilities.
OpenLane Output#
All output run data is placed by default under ./designs/design_name/runs. Each flow cycle will output a timestamp-marked folder containing the following file structure:
<design_name>
├── config.json/config.tcl
├── runs
│   ├── <tag>
│   │   ├── config.tcl
│   │   ├── {logs, reports, tmp}
