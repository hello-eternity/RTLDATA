Viewing layouts graphically#
You can use gui.py to view final layout from a specified run and from the major stages of the flow.
Available viewers are OpenROAD and KLayout.
Usage#
To view the final layout using OpenROAD:
make mount
python3 gui.py --viewer openroad ./designs/spm/runs/RUN_2023.05.28_13.36.45
To view the layout from floorplan stage:
make mount
python3 gui.py --viewer openroad --stage floorplan ./designs/spm/runs/RUN_2023.05.28_13.36.45
Finally, you can chose to open def view instead of odb view:
make mount
python3 gui.py --format def --viewer openroad --stage floorplan ./designs/spm/runs/RUN_2023.05.28_13.36.45
Note
The script needs to run from the same environment as the OpenLane run, i.e.,
if youâ€™re using OpenLane using make mount and the Docker container, gui.py
must be run from the Docker container.
