Interactive Mode#
You may run the flow interactively by using the -interactive option:
./flow.tcl -interactive
A tcl shell will be opened where the openlane package is automatically sourced:
package require openlane
Then, you should be able to run the following main commands:
Any valid Tcl code.
prep -design <design> [-tag TAG] [-config CONFIG] [-init_design_config] [-overwrite]
run_synthesis
run_floorplan
run_placement
run_cts
run_routing
write_powered_verilog followed by set_netlist $::env(routing_logs)/$::env(DESIGN_NAME).powered.v
run_magic
run_magic_spice_export
run_magic_drc
run_lvs
run_antenna_check
Note
The commands should all be run in this order- skipping any may lead to
unexpected behavior.
You are free however to add any intermediate commands to achieve more complex
functionality.
The above commands can also be written in a file and passed to flow.tcl as shown:
./flow.tcl -interactive -file <file>
A comprehensive list of commands supported by OpenLane can be found
here.
